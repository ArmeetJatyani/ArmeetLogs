Made a little program that keeps log of what you do.
You can add entries for each day.
It will compile your entries into a json file which can be used later.
Finally it will push the logs up to github.
There is an option to open the github repo from the terminal.


lets make another entry...




















I am working on making this an in command line feature that could be added to the path
Maybe even an exe file
Also, thinking about making it a per project log, where people can run commands like
log -m "Worked on _____ today"
json might look like...

{
	"2019":[
		{
		"author": "Armeet Jatyani",
		"date": "year-month-day"m
		"commitHash": "github commit hash (number)",
		"message": "content of log",
	]
}
